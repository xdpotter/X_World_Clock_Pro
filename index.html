  <h2>Welcome to X World Clock</h2>
  <p>
    X World Clock is a simple and reliable online tool designed to help users check the current time
    in countries all around the world. Whether you are a traveler, student, remote worker,
    business professional, or simply curious about global time differences, this website makes
    it easy to stay informed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Time zones can be confusing, especially when communicating with people in different parts of
    the world. X World Clock removes that confusion by showing live, accurate local time updates
    for every supported country in real time.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is a World Clock?</h2>
  <p>
    A world clock is a tool that displays the current local time in different countries and regions
    across the globe. Because the Earth rotates, different areas experience daylight and nighttime
    at different moments. To manage this, the world is divided into multiple time zones.
  </p>

  <p>
    With a world clock, users can instantly check what time it is in another country without
    needing to manually calculate hours or worry about time zone differences.
  </p>

  <h2>How Time Zones Work</h2>
  <p>
    The Earth is divided into 24 main time zones, roughly corresponding to the 24 hours in a day.
    Each time zone usually represents a one-hour difference from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
    Some regions also use half-hour or quarter-hour offsets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Time zones help keep daily schedules aligned with daylight hours. Without time zones,
    global communication, travel, and international business would be extremely difficult.
  </p>

  <h2>Understanding UTC and GMT</h2>
  <p>
    Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the primary time standard used worldwide. It is not tied
    to any specific country and serves as the reference point for all time zones.
  </p>

  <p>
    Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is a time system historically used in the United Kingdom. While GMT
    and UTC are often the same, UTC is more precise and is now the global standard used for
    scientific and technical purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Daylight Saving Time Explained</h2>
  <p>
    Some countries adjust their clocks during certain parts of the year using Daylight Saving Time (DST).
    This usually involves moving clocks forward by one hour to make better use of daylight during
    longer summer days.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not all countries observe Daylight Saving Time, and the start and end dates vary by region.
    This makes checking local time manually difficult, which is why a world clock tool is so helpful.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Use X World Clock?</h2>

<div class="container content-section">
    <h2>Understanding World Time Zones</h2>
    <p>Managing time across the globe can be complex due to the 24 longitudinal divisions known as time zones. X World Clock helps you navigate these differences instantly. But why do we have time zones?</p>
    
    <h3>The History of GMT and UTC</h3>
    <p>Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) was originally established in 1675 to aid mariners. Today, the world uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is more precise. When you search for time in London or New York, our tool calculates the offset from UTC to give you the exact second.</p>

    <h3>How Daylight Savings Affects You</h3>
    <p>Many countries, like the USA and those in the UK, shift their clocks twice a year. This "Spring Forward" and "Fall Back" can cause confusion for international business meetings. Our clock updates automatically to reflect these changes so you never miss a call.</p>

    <h3>Tips for Global Scheduling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identify Overlap:</strong> Find hours where both parties are awake (typically 12 PM - 5 PM UTC).</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Comparison Tool:</strong> Use our <a href="index.html#compare">Compare Page</a> to see the time difference side-by-side.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Holidays:</strong> Remember that time zones don't account for local public holidays.</li>
    </ul>
